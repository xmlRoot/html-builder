The history of Star Wars: The Old Republic is a rich tapestry of conflict and alliance, spanning thousands of years. The era began with the formation of the Galactic Republic, a time when the galaxy was a much smaller place. Key planets like Chandrila and Alderaan were among the first to join, setting the stage for a republic that would grow to encompass countless worlds. This period was marked by the collaboration between the Republic and the Jedi Order, who together navigated the galaxy through numerous historical epochs. The Republic's early days were fraught with challenges, but its foundation laid the groundwork for the expansive universe fans know today.
